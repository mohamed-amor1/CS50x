CSS frameworks and libraries that offer pre-designed table styles:

Semantic UI - https://semantic-ui.com/collections/table.html
Materialize - https://materializecss.com/table.html
Bulma - https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/
Foundation - https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/components/tables.html

Each of these frameworks has its own table styles that I can use in my project. To use them, I will need to include their CSS file in my HTML file
