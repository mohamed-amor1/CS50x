<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
This is a basic HTML document that contains a page title and some text in the body.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration at the beginning of the code tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.

The <html> element is the root element of the document, and the lang attribute is used to specify the language of the document.

The <head> element contains metadata about the document, such as the title of the page, which is specified using the <title> element.

The <body> element contains the visible content of the document, which in this case is the text "hello, friend".-->
