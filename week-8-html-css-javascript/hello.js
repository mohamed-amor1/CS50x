/* This JavaScript code is adding an event listener to a form element in an HTML document. Here's a breakdown of what each line of the code is doing:

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {...});
This line adds an event listener to the DOMContentLoaded event, which fires when the HTML document has finished loading and is ready to be manipulated by JavaScript. When the DOMContentLoaded event fires, the function inside the curly braces will be executed.

document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", function (event) {...});
Inside the function for the DOMContentLoaded event listener, this line adds another event listener to the first form element found in the HTML document using the querySelector() method. The event being listened for is the submit event, which fires when the user submits the form by clicking the submit button or pressing the Enter key. When the submit event fires, the function inside the curly braces will be executed.

let name = document.querySelector("#name").value;
Inside the function for the submit event listener, this line gets the value of the input field with the ID name using the querySelector() method, and assigns it to a variable called name.

alert("hello, " + name);
This line displays an alert message with the text "hello, " followed by the value of the name variable.

event.preventDefault();
Finally, this line prevents the default behavior of the form when it's submitted, which is to reload the page. By calling event.preventDefault(), the page will not be reloaded, and the user will remain on the same page after submitting the form.

So in summary, this code adds a submit event listener to a form element, gets the value of an input field when the form is submitted, displays an alert message with the input value, and prevents the page from being reloaded when the form is submitted.*/
