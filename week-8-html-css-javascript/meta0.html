    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
    make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
    was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<!--The <meta> tag you provided sets the viewport properties for the web page. The viewport is the user's visible area of the web page, and its size can vary depending on the device and screen size being used to view the web page.

The content attribute of the <meta> tag specifies the initial scale and width of the viewport. In particular:

initial-scale=1 sets the initial zoom level of the page to 100%, meaning that the page will be displayed at its actual size on the device.
width=device-width sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device being used to view the page. This means that the page will be scaled to fit the device screen, which is especially important for mobile devices with smaller screens.
By setting the viewport properties in this way, the web page will be more easily readable and navigable on different devices with different screen sizes, and it will also help to ensure that the layout of the page is consistent across different devices.
