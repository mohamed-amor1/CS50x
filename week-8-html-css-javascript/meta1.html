<!--This code defines a few Open Graph (OG) meta tags in the head section of an HTML document. These tags are used by social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others to display rich previews of shared links.

Here's what each tag does:

<meta property="og:title" content="CS50" />: This tag sets the title of the shared link to "CS50". When someone shares the link on social media, this is the title that will be displayed in the preview.
<meta property="og:description" content="Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming." />: This tag sets the description of the shared link to "Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming." This description will be displayed in the social media preview.
<meta property="og:image" content="cat.jpg" />: This tag sets the image that will be displayed in the social media preview to "cat.jpg". This should be a URL to an image file that will be displayed along with the title and description.
By including these meta tags in the head section of your HTML document, you can control how your shared links will appear on social media platforms.
